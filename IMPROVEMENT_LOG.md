## Current State (Baseline - 2026-03-20)

**Repo:** https://github.com/cheenu1092-oss/netmcp
**Packages:** 5 (oui-lookup, rfc-search, nvd-network-cves, fcc-devices, threegpp-specs)
**Tools:** 17 total across all packages
**Tests:** 17/17 passing (as of Feb 9 review)
**Grade:** A- (90/100) from automated review
**Last commit:** 2026-03-20 (URL/license cleanup)

### Known Issues (from CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md & REVIEW.md)
1. Input sanitization needed across packages (oui_search, fcc_search)
2. No limit validation caps (could request unlimited results)
3. No MAC format hex validation in oui-lookup
4. node_modules committed to git (need proper .gitignore)
5. No CI/CD pipeline
6. No TypeScript or JSDoc types
7. No caching for external APIs (NVD has strict rate limits)
8. Basic smoke tests only — no edge case or integration tests
9. No CHANGELOG.md
10. No npm publish configuration
11. No monorepo tooling (no workspaces)
12. Apify actor configs may have stale URLs

### Priority Order for Improvements
1. **Security:** Input sanitization, validation
2. **Infrastructure:** .gitignore, CI/CD, npm publish config
3. **Reliability:** Error handling, timeouts, caching, rate limiting
4. **Quality:** TypeScript/JSDoc, better tests, CHANGELOG
5. **Features:** New tools (IANA ports, DNS, BGP looking glass, Wireshark dissectors)
6. **Polish:** README improvements, architecture diagrams, demo scripts

## Cycle Log

### Cycle 1 — 2026-03-20 11:20 AM PST

**What was inspected:**
- Reviewed CODE_REVIEW_NOTES.md security findings
- Checked git history (last 5 commits were repo cleanup)
- Verified current state of high-priority security issues

**Findings:**
- ✅ SQL injection in fcc-devices ALREADY FIXED (sanitizeInput function in place)
- ✅ Input sanitization in oui-lookup ALREADY FIXED (query sanitization + limit cap at 100)
- ✅ .gitignore exists and works (node_modules not tracked)
- ❌ NO CI/CD pipeline — identified as next priority

**What was built:**
1. Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow
   - Tests all 17 tools across Node.js 18.x, 20.x, 22.x
   - Runs on push/PR to main, master, dev branches
   - Includes code quality checks (console.log, TODO/FIXME detection)
   - Uploads test results as artifacts (7-day retention)
2. Added CI badge to README.md
3. Switched git remote to SSH to push workflow (HTTPS token lacked workflow scope)

**Test results:**
- ✅ All 17 tools PASS locally
- ✅ Commit 7c6a4d8 pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ GitHub Actions will run on next push (workflow now in place)

**Git commits:**
- `7c6a4d8` — "ci: add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing"

**Next cycle priorities:**
1. Verify GitHub Actions runs successfully (check https://github.com/cheenu1092-oss/netmcp/actions)
2. Add CHANGELOG.md (priority #9 from backlog)
3. Add caching layer for NVD API calls (priority #6 - rate limits are strict)
4. Improve error handling for network timeouts (priority #5)
5. Consider adding TypeScript/JSDoc types (priority #4)

### Cycle 2 — 2026-03-20 11:21 AM PST

**What was inspected:**
- Analyzed existing timeout implementations across all packages
- Found inconsistent network timeout handling:
  - ✅ fcc-devices: 15s timeout with AbortController
  - ✅ threegpp-specs: 10s timeout with AbortController
  - ❌ rfc-search: NO timeout (can hang indefinitely)
  - ❌ nvd-network-cves: NO timeout (can hang indefinitely)
  - N/A oui-lookup: No network calls (local database)

**Findings:**
- **Critical reliability issue:** rfc-search and nvd-network-cves can hang indefinitely if IETF or NVD APIs stall
- User impact: Frozen tools, unclear errors, poor production experience
- This is higher priority than CHANGELOG or caching (reliability > documentation/optimization)

**What was built:**
1. **rfc-search timeout fix:**
   - Added AbortController with 10s timeout to `fetchJSON()`
   - Consistent with threegpp-specs pattern
   - Clear error message: "Request timeout after 10000ms"
   
2. **nvd-network-cves timeout fix:**
   - Added AbortController with 15s timeout to `fetchNVD()`
   - Longer timeout because NVD API is slower than IETF
   - User-friendly error: "NVD API timeout after 15000ms. The API may be overloaded, try again later."

**Test results:**
- ✅ **All 17 tools PASS** after timeout implementation
- ✅ No regressions, all edge cases still handled correctly
- Test runtime: ~18s (NVD rate limiting adds delays)

**Git commits:**
- `59f9db8` — "fix: add network timeouts to rfc-search and nvd-network-cves"
- Pushed to main successfully

**Impact:**
- Prevents indefinite hangs in production
- All 5 packages now have consistent timeout handling
- Better user experience with clear timeout error messages

**Next cycle priorities:**
1. Add CHANGELOG.md (documentation priority)
2. Add caching layer for NVD API calls (reduce rate limit pressure)
3. Add monorepo tooling (workspaces in root package.json)
4. Consider adding TypeScript/JSDoc types for better DX
5. Add more comprehensive test cases (edge cases, error conditions)
